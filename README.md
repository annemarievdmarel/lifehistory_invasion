# lifehistory_invasion

Here we provide the code and datafiles of a study investigating the role of life history traits and introduction effort in understanding invasion success in mammals. 
AIM 1: we investigated life history traits of the Barbary ground squirrel, _Atlantoxerus getulus_, a species with a remarkable low introduction effort. 
AIM 2: we studied whether the Barbary ground squirrel's exceptional invasion success (despite low introduction effort) is due to a very fast life history profile 
through a comparison of these traits to other successfully invaded mammals using the dataset provided by Capellini et al (2015). 
AIM 3: we examined whether number of founders and/or a fast life history influences invasion success of squirrels using the dataset provided by Bertolino (2009).  

The R code is provided in the Rmarkdown file "life history traits.Rmd".
